<h2> Describing myself</h2>
<p>  I describe myself as a very joyful and talkative person overall. I am also a very athletic person as my favorite hobbies are playing soccer and running. I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I also really enjoying problem-solving which is a reason why I have chosen to major in CS. My ambitions have always driven me to be the best I can be. This is why one day I hope to create an app and publish it.
