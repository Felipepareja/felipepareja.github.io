      <p> This is my finalized programming portfolio website for CSC106- The Joy of Programming at the University of Rhode Island. On this website, you will see all the programs I have created throughout the semester. I created this website using HTML and styled it using CSS which I learned from Khan academy. Feel free to visit my other pages to view my programs and also to learn more about me.
